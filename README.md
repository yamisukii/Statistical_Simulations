# Statistical Simulations in R

This repository contains 10 different statistical simulations, all implemented in **R**. Each simulation explores a different statistical method, showcasing various approaches to data generation, estimation, and analysis.

## Contents

All simulations are provided as **PDF** files, summarizing the methodology, implementation, and results.

## Notes

- The simulations were conducted entirely in **R**.
- Each PDF corresponds to a different statistical simulation method.
- No raw R scripts are includedâ€”only the final results in PDF format.

Feel free to explore the PDFs to see different statistical approaches in action!
